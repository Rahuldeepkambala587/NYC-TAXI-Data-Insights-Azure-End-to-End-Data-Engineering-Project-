# NYC-TAXI-Data-Insights-Azure-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-
The NYC Taxi Trip Insights Pipeline is designed to process large-scale taxi trip data efficiently using Azure services. The goal is to demonstrate expertise in data ingestion, transformation, and storage while optimizing performance and cost.
Business Goal
The goal of this project is to leverage NYC taxi trip data to enhance operational efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall service planning. To achieve this, we aim to:
•	Understand demand patterns – Identify peak hours, high-demand locations, and seasonal trends to help taxi operators optimize fleet distribution.
•	Optimize fare structures – Analyze trip distances, durations, and pricing strategies to ensure competitive and profitable fare models.
•	Build a scalable data pipeline – Process real-time and batch data efficiently for future forecasting and analytics.
•	Provide insights for stakeholders – Deliver clean, structured, and aggregated data for easy consumption in Power BI to support business decision-making.

2️⃣ Architecture & Tech Stack
Tools & Services Used:
•	Data Ingestion: Azure Data Factory (ADF) (REST API ingestion)
•	Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)
•	Processing: Azure Databricks (PySpark transformations)
•	Storage Format: Delta Lake (for data versioning & optimization)
•	Visualization: Power BI
Architecture Flow:
1.	Ingestion Layer (Bronze): Data is pulled from the taxi API and stored in raw format in ADLS.
2.	Processing Layer (Silver): Databricks reads Bronze data, applies transformations, and saves it in optimized Parquet format.
3.	Serving Layer (Gold): Data is further aggregated and stored in Delta Tables for analytics and reporting.
4.	Consumption: Data is visualized in Power BI.

3️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
•	Used Azure Data Factory to fetch data from the taxi API.
•	Implemented ForEach Activity to load data in parallel.
•	Stored raw JSON/CSV files in ADLS.
Step 2: Transformation (Silver Layer)
•	Used Databricks with Service Principal to access ADLS.
•	Cleaned missing values, standardized timestamps, and converted data to Parquet format.
•	Applied partitioning for faster querying.
Step 3: Data Aggregation & Storage (Gold Layer)
•	Moved data from Silver to Gold using Delta Lake.
•	Created Delta Tables to enable data versioning and schema evolution.
Step 4: Data Visualization
•	Connected Power BI to ADLS for building dashboards.
•	Analyzed fare trends, trip density, and peak demand times.
