## 🎯 1️⃣ Business Goal
The goal of this project is to leverage NYC taxi trip data to enhance operational efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall service planning.  

### Key Objectives:
- 📈 **Understand demand patterns** – Identify peak hours, high-demand locations, and seasonal trends to help taxi operators optimize fleet distribution.  
- 💰 **Optimize fare structures** – Analyze trip distances, durations, and pricing strategies to ensure competitive and profitable fare models.  
- ⚡ **Build a scalable data pipeline** – Process real-time and batch data efficiently for future forecasting and analytics.  
- 📊 **Provide insights for stakeholders** – Deliver clean, structured, and aggregated data for easy consumption in Power BI to support business decision-making.

## 🏗️ 2️⃣ Architecture & Tech Stack

### Architecture:
<img width="823" height="484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74a01106-4633-4a9b-9f80-e92fb9170016" />

### Tools & Services Used:
- 🔄 **Data Ingestion**: Azure Data Factory (ADF) – REST API ingestion  
- 🗄️ **Storage**: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) – Bronze, Silver, Gold layers  
- 🔥 **Processing**: Azure Databricks (PySpark transformations)  
- 🗃️ **Storage Format**: Delta Lake – for data versioning & optimization  
- 📈 **Visualization**: Power BI  

### Architecture Flow:
1. **Ingestion Layer (Bronze)** – Data is pulled from the taxi API and stored in raw format in ADLS.  
2. **Processing Layer (Silver)** – Databricks reads Bronze data, applies transformations, and saves it in optimized Parquet format.  
3. **Serving Layer (Gold)** – Data is further aggregated and stored in Delta Tables for analytics and reporting.  
4. **Consumption** – Data is visualized in Power BI.

## 🔄 3️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
- 🌐 Used Azure Data Factory to fetch data from the taxi API.  
- 🔄 Implemented ForEach Activity to load data in parallel.  
- 🗄️ Stored raw JSON/CSV files in ADLS.  

### Step 2: Transformation (Silver Layer)
- 🔥 Used Databricks with Service Principal to access ADLS.  
- 🧹 Cleaned missing values, standardized timestamps, and converted data to Parquet format.  
- 📂 Applied partitioning for faster querying.  

### Step 3: Data Aggregation & Storage (Gold Layer)
- 🗃️ Moved data from Silver to Gold using Delta Lake.  
- 🔄 Created Delta Tables to enable data versioning and schema evolution.  

### Step 4: Data Visualization
- 📈 Connected Power BI to ADLS for building dashboards.  
- 🔍 Analyzed fare trends, trip density, and peak demand times.
